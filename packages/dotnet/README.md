# Polymorfa .NET SDK

Handwritten server SDK for .NET 8 and later. This package is in development and has not been published to NuGet. It uses the API contract revision `2026-09-22` pinned in this repository.

Create a messaging client with an organization API key or a project token. Keep server credentials in your server process.

```csharp
using Polymorfa.Sdk;

using var client = new MessagingClient(
    Credential.OrganizationApiKey(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("POLYMORFA_API_KEY")!));
var response = await client.Messages.SendAsync(
    "support",
    new SendMessageRequest(
        new ConversationReference(PhoneNumber: "+15551234567"),
        new TextContent("Hello")));
Console.WriteLine(response.Data.Data.Id);
```

Organization and project clients provide immutable project views. A project token requires an explicit project ID and cannot be rebound to another project. Messaging client tokens cannot call server administration methods.

Every response includes status, API version, request ID, attempt count, and safe response headers. Request options support cancellation, timeout, API version, custom headers, and an explicit idempotency key. Safe reads and keyed writes retry transient failures; ordinary writes do not. Message sends use a stable key throughout retries. Call links and transient call reactions never retry automatically.

`Webhooks.ConstructEvent` verifies native HMAC signatures against the exact raw request bytes before parsing. `ConstructLocalEvent` separately verifies timestamped CLI forwarding signatures. Unknown event names retain their envelope and payload. Deduplicate processed event IDs in your application.

Typed resources include sessions, all 20 message content kinds, QuickLinks, webhooks, Business, Channels, contacts, groups, hosted history, profile, presence, labels, privacy, identities, client token rules, organization metadata, billing, customer management, project settings, BanSafe, Flows, Functions, Voice, usage, SIP, and call controls. Native HTTP tests check the methods recorded in `coverage.json`.

Known webhooks have typed payloads for all 84 names in the pinned TypeScript contract. Unknown events retain their envelope and payload. Event streams provide asynchronous enumeration and resume from a saved cursor. Media helpers verify SHA-256 and HMAC before releasing decrypted content; API downloads use a separate credential-free storage client. Voice upload sends bytes over that independent storage transport, then completes the asset through the API.

Remaining resource families, server Calls sockets, and framework examples are in progress. The coverage ledger records those gaps. This package does not claim TypeScript parity or customer availability.

Signal integration is owned by the Signal workstream and is outside this package change.
